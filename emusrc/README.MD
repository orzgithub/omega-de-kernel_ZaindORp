## About building the jagoomba on your own
Now we are using jagoomba as a submodule for this project to keep it always up to date without any extra operation. But by default jagoomba is not set for EZ ODE. There's a pre-built binary included in the source so it's not necessary to build it by yourself. But if you wish to, please do as bellow.<br>
Open the folder ``jagoomba/src`` and find config.h. Edit it with the text editer you prefer. Find ``#define EZFLASH_DE_BUILD 0`` and change 0 to 1 to make it to be built for EZ ODE.<br>
After that just build it as normal, add devkitpro to the PATH, set the path for ``DEVKITARM``, ``DEVKITPRO`` and ``LIBGBA``, use make to build it(Several issues about compilation have been mentioned in jagoomba's github repo. Please read that first.) and use ``bin2c -o goomba.h <path/to/goomba.gba>`` to convert it to a head file which can be linked with main function and replace ``goomba.h`` in the src file with the one you built.<br>
For windows users ZaindORp made a script to build it and copy the goomba.h to the src folder. But you should still modify ``jagoomba/src/config.h`` and install the latest devkitpro with libgba to use it. If you install the devkitpro in a custome path instead of ``C:\devkitpro``, you should also change the path in the script.
