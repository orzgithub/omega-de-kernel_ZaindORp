Jaga's Goomba Color fork

A fork of Goomba Color with the goal of fixing bugs and incompatibilities in the original.  Based on the 2019-05-04 source.

The games I'd like to get running are:
- Donkey Kong Land: New Colors Mode, https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6076/.  Can't reach the file select screen (should be fixed as of v0.4)
- Kirby's Dream Land DX Service Repair, https://www.romhacking.net/hacks/6224/.  Palette issues in Level 2 and onwards (should be fixed as of v0.2)
- Konami GB Collections 2 and 4.  Don't boot (should be fixed as of v0.1)
- Pokemon Crystal.  Heavy graphical corruption after displaying text (should be fixed as of v0.3)

To build:
- Install the latest DevkitPro GBA tools
- Navigate to this directory
- make
- Rename font.lz77.o to font.o and fontpal.bin.o to fontpal.o
- make

To test, I build a ROM with the resulting goomba.gba and the game I'm testing using goombafront.exe, then run it in mGBA.  You can find goombafront.exe as part of the Goomba Color releases.

Thanks to:

- Minucce for help with ASM and pointing me in the right direction.
- Sterophonick for code tweaks and featuring Jagoomba in the excellent Simple kernel for the EZ-Flash Omega carts: https://gbatemp.net/threads/new-theme-for-ez-flash-omega.520665/
- EZ-Flash for releasing the source to their modified Goomba Color builds, which hopefully allows this to support the Omega Definitive Edition's rumble features.
